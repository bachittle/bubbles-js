# bubbles-js
animated bubbles library (not just the water ones!)

### questions
- Why not do all shapes instead of just spheres?

this is planned for the future, but for now I'm sticking by a design philosophy of keeping things simple. More shapes will mean more complications such as inheritance, new properties, etc. This library is just focused on bubbles, and will be able to be modified by a universal json modification script that I will define and use throughout all the visual libraries I make.
